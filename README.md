# Supply-chain-shipment-cost-prediction
This is my internship project, In this I have used the shipment dataset of various pharma companies and tried to predict dhipment prices using machine learning 

The dataset is given in the repository, however you can also take it from kaggle or USAID website

kaggle dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyeshardeshana/supply-chain-shipment-pricing-data

USAID dataset link (Original dataset) : https://data.usaid.gov/HIV-AIDS/Supply-Chain-Shipment-Pricing-Data/a3rc-nmf6

Please also refer the Data dictionary given in the repository for better understanding of the data

I ran various classical regression models for training on the data, and as per my analysis the best performing model is **XGBoost** with an amazing MAE of 0.05 , MSE of 0.01 and R-Squared error of 0.95.
I also did lot of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning to further improve the performance of the models.
